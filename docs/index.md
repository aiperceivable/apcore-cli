# apcore-cli

**The CLI Adapter for apcore — Expose modules as high-performance, AI-perceivable command-line tools.**

> Build once, invoke by Code, AI, or Terminal.

apcore-cli takes your **apcore modules** and automatically exposes them as **CLI subcommands** — with zero code changes. It is the terminal-native counterpart to `apcore-mcp` (Model Context Protocol) and `apcore-a2a` (Agent-to-Agent).

## Key Features

- **Zero-code CLI generation** — `create_cli()` scans your extensions directory and registers every module as a subcommand automatically.
- **AI-perceivable output** — `--format json` emits structured JSON consumed by AI agents; TTY mode renders rich tables for humans.
- **Full apcore pipeline integration** — `--dry-run`, `--trace`, `--strategy`, and `--stream` expose the apcore execution pipeline directly from the terminal.
- **Cross-language** — identical CLI behaviour across Python, TypeScript, and Rust SDKs, verified by the shared conformance suite.
- **Exposure filtering** — `expose:` in `apcore.yaml` controls which modules appear as commands (whitelist / blacklist / glob patterns).

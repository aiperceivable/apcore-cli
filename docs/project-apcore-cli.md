## Requirement Traceability

Maps high-level requirements (from [ideas/draft.md](../ideas/draft.md)) to feature-level requirements.

| Idea Req | Description | Feature Specs |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| FR-001 | Mapping of Canonical ID to subcommands | FR-01-01, FR-01-02 |

## Project Dependencies
- `apcore >= 0.17.1` (Core protocol, Registry, Executor, error hierarchy, Config Bus, Execution Pipeline Strategy)
- `click >= 8.1` (CLI framework — confirmed in [Tech Design v1.0](tech-design.md), ADR-01)
- `jsonschema >= 4.20` (JSON Schema validation and parsing)
- `rich >= 13.0` (Terminal output formatting — tables, syntax highlighting)
- `pyyaml >= 6.0` (Configuration file parsing)
- `keyring >= 24.0` (OS keyring for encrypted config storage)
- `cryptography >= 41.0` (AES-256-GCM encryption)

## Implementation Order

1. **Config Resolver** (FE-07): Foundation for all configurable values.
2. **Core Dispatcher** (FE-01): Establishes the `apcore-cli` command structure and registry loading.
3. **Schema Parser** (FE-02): Connects module metadata to the command-line arguments.
4. **Output Formatter** (FE-08): TTY-adaptive rendering used by Discovery and exec.
5. **Discovery** (FE-04): Provides tools for browsing available modules.
6. **Approval Gate** (FE-03): Adds governance and safety for sensitive module execution.
7. **Security Manager** (FE-05): Authentication, encryption, auditing, sandboxing.
8. **Shell Integration** (FE-06): Completion scripts and man pages.

## MVP Definition
A functional `apcore-cli` command that can load a local `apcore` extensions directory, parse arguments for a simple module, and execute it while handling basic STDIN piping.
